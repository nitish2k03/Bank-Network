# Bank-Network

Network Design Proposal for Bank using Packet Tracer.

This design is very basic and is easy to understand.

Software Used : Packet Tracer

In this we have designed a network for a bank in which each branch has different network Id.All computers and printers can ping each other. We also have applied a firewall for 
the security purposes so if anyone tries to ping the server, the ping fails. We have provided each branch with a Wireless Router so the smart devices can wirelessly be 
connected in the network. Every router is configured that automatically provides an Internet Protocol (IP) host with its IP address and other related configuration information
such as the subnet mask and default gateway. We have also enabled services like FTP,DNS on the server.
